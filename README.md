From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

This was my attempt at the first webdesign by going directly in the code. I was a challenge, but it helped me to learn a bit CSS and HTML. I took inspiration from [mgrumbo](https://github.com/mgrumbo/google-homepage/blob/master/index.html) code and learned from it. I still have work to do to learn and understand optimal structure, especialy how to make nice and slick CSS, but It was a very fun challenge. I recommend Odin Project to everyone.
